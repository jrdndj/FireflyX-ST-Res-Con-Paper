\begin{abstract}

% Music composition is a delicate and disciplined art form that is tedious and repetitive. In this preliminary study, we explore the design of an interaction that aims to balance the work of composers with the help of a mobile application. The process of musical composition is not easy for composers. Certain tasks such as figuring out succeeding notes often requires trial-and-error, as well as knowledge of certain theories. Existing technology has employed musical metacreation to assist in this process. This endows machines with the artificial creative capacity to perform musical tasks. In review, the existing technology has not been generally-used in all stages of the musical composition process. By combining several interaction technologies, composers can benefit by being able to do their tasks with significantly less cognitive load and time.

 Music is an important facet for human expression that it presents a universal platform for conveying ideas, feelings, and emotion. The Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) community does not experience music the same way hearing people experience music. This research explores the creation of a music visualization system towards enhancing the musical experience of the DHH, by enabling them to grasp the essence, and the emotion, carried by music despite their physical shortcomings. The researchers have conducted two (2) iterations of experiments to evaluate the implemented system, which is continually improved after each iteration. The first iteration focused on laying the foundation and basic functionality of the prototype. The experiment was to determine if the participants had emotional responses to the music and visuals, and if there was a pattern in their collective responses. Results show that louder and faster songs do not necessarily elicit positive emotional responses. The second iteration improved upon the prototype, adding more visual elements. The experiment aimed to determine whether the speed of the song correlated to the elicited emotions. Based on the results, little to no correlations were observed between emotion felt and beats per minute (BPM) of the songs tested.
