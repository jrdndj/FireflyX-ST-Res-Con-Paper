\begin{abstract}

% Music composition is a delicate and disciplined art form that is tedious and repetitive. In this preliminary study, we explore the design of an interaction that aims to balance the work of composers with the help of a mobile application. The process of musical composition is not easy for composers. Certain tasks such as figuring out succeeding notes often requires trial-and-error, as well as knowledge of certain theories. Existing technology has employed musical metacreation to assist in this process. This endows machines with the artificial creative capacity to perform musical tasks. In review, the existing technology has not been generally-used in all stages of the musical composition process. By combining several interaction technologies, composers can benefit by being able to do their tasks with significantly less cognitive load and time.

%  Music is an important facet for human expression that it presents a universal platform for conveying ideas, feelings, and emotion. The Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) community does not experience music the same way hearing people experience music. This research explores the creation of a music visualization system towards enhancing the musical experience of the DHH, by enabling them to grasp the essence, and the emotion, carried by music despite their physical shortcomings. The researchers have conducted two (2) iterations of experiments to evaluate the implemented system, which is continually improved after each iteration. The first iteration focused on laying the foundation and basic functionality of the prototype. The experiment was to determine if the participants had emotional responses to the music and visuals, and if there was a pattern in their collective responses. Results show that louder and faster songs do not necessarily elicit positive emotional responses. The second iteration improved upon the prototype, adding more visual elements. The experiment aimed to determine whether the speed of the song correlated to the elicited emotions. Based on the results, little to no correlations were observed between emotion felt and beats per minute (BPM) of the songs tested. 

 Music can trigger many types of memories in children and can be used to engage with them at any time. It is an integral part of their lives helping them understand the different complexities of life. Yet music has many complex properties that make it difficult to learn. This research explores the playful interactions exhibited by children in learning through a playful mobile musical interface. In using the innate playful nature of children, a sandbox environment was implemented to supplement the experiences of learning music. We have designed gestures that allows children to playfully interact with a firefly model that represents different musical rudiments, such as tempo, rhythm, beat-rest patterns, pitch, notes, measures, and sections. This was accomplished through the use of a human-centered design process of understanding children, and music teachers. We have created a version 1 of the prototype and we have done usability testing on this version. The findings that were gathered have guided us in the design and development of the iterative prototype that was tested in one iteration by the children. Results so far have show that children after many repetitions of a task were keen in finding patterns in elements in the screen such as color and size that represented a specific element of music. For the upcoming second iteration we shall use the comments from the version 1 testing to come up with a version 2 prototype. More feedback through different iterations of these usability tests will allow us to discover more human factors that are exhibited by children when doing music composition tasks Lastly,the function of this tool will contribute in creating a child friendly interface for children to learn a hard concept like music.
